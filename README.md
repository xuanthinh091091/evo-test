# Candidate
Recruitment Test

## Intent
The intent of this test is to validate the technical capabilities of the candidate to perform simple technical tasks.
All work should be completed within two to four hour(s).

## Description
ABC company runs an ecommerce store selling books.  To fulfil this functionality, you need to complete the following user stories:

1. As a customer, I want to be able to view a list of books available for sale.
2. As a customer, I want to be able to select the book I want, to view a detailed description of the book.
3. As a customer, I want to be able to place an order for the book and provide delivery instructions. Note that this requirement does not require completing the payment of the book.
4. As a shop admin, I want to view the list of the books I currently sell in the store.
5. As a shop admin, I want to see the list of the orders placed by the customers so that I can begin to fulfil the orders.

## Technical Stack
Candidates will be judged on the basis of ability to complete the tasks listed in functional code.
Extra credit will be given to developers who can leverage containers to allow the spin up of the functional code on a local machine.
Do specify the technology stack used, including language, framework, database backend etc.

Judgement criteria will not be based on the asthetics and design of the UX, as the company already has a capable designer.

Independent of the tech stack used, we expect the candidate to submit the code repository used retrievable over public internet, 
ideally with instructions on how to set up and run the application.

## Submission
Submission can be done in the following manners via email to [eng-hr@withevo.com](mailto:eng-hr@withevo.com):
